This script is designed for the Roblox game BlockSpin. It intelligently hops servers based on player count and proximity, helping you avoid crowded servers and stay low-key for farming or grinding.

Proximity Detection:
If any player gets within 35 studs of you, the script will hop to a new server.

Live GUI Status:
A draggable GUI shows your current status: Safe, Too Many Players, Player Close, etc.

Toggle ON/OFF Button:
Easily start or stop detection with a button built into the GUI.

No Server Repeats:
Keeps track of visited servers and only revisits once all others are cycled through.

Teleport Script Loading:
Automatically queues up your main grind scripts on teleport.
