[NEW RELEASE] BlockSpin Low-Player Server Hopper + Auto-Farm Script [Delta / Mobile Compatible]

This script is built to automatically join low-populated servers, detect nearby players, and server hop when needed — all while running a powerful auto-farming system in the background. Ideal for AFK farming, stealth grinding, and mobile users with Delta Executor.

Features:

Smart Server Hopper: Automatically joins servers with 1–4 players max (ensuring you won't join crowded servers).

Live Player Count GUI: Shows how many players are in your current server.

Auto Escape: Instantly hops to a new low-pop server if:

Someone gets too close

Server exceeds 5 total players


Toggle Button: Turn detection On (green) or Off (red) whenever you want.

Never Repeats Servers: Keeps track of visited servers and only joins new ones.

Modern, Minimal GUI: Optimized for mobile devices and Delta’s UI.

Reliable and crash-resistant: No more stuck states or broken detection.
